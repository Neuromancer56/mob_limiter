# Mob Limiter

Removes mobs over max count near players.
Every so many seconds the mod checks for mobs near the player and if there are too many it removes them.
This mod was written to be used with Mobs Redo API.  It may or may not have an effect on mobs spawned using other APIs (for example Creatura).

Usage:
