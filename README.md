# Mob Limiter

Removes mobs over max count near players.
The inspiration for this mod is I had a Minetest server that kept crashing due to too many mobs being spawned by mob mod.  
Every so many seconds the mod checks for mobs near the player and if there are too many it removes the extras.
This mod was written to be used with Mobs Redo API.  It may or may not have an effect on mobs spawned using other APIs (for example Creatura).

Usage:
Enable the mod
